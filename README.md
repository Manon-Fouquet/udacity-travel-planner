# purpose
The website is a travel application pulling data from different sources.

The project includes a simple form where you enter the location you are traveling to and the date you are leaving. If the trip is within a week, you will get the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, you will get a predicted forecast. There will be also an image of the location entered.
